?> sha256 hashes can be calculated for downloaded files by running `sha256sum <downloaded-file>`, and the output compared to the hashes above to ensure integrity.

 - These images require a 16Gb or larger SD card.
 - The easiest way to write the images to SD card is using the excellent [Etcher](https://etcher.io/)

### Raspberry/Raspberry Lite Instructions
The Raspberry Pi platform is a 'first class' supported platform in Maverick - ie. we aim to provide an optimal experience on this platform.
Getting Maverick working on the Raspberry is straight forward.  There are two images - Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi Lite.
 - The full version is optimised to use all cores and features of the more advanced quad-core CPU available in the Model A/B 3+/4.
 - The 'Lite' version is targeted mainly at the single-core Raspberry boards like the Model 1/2/3/Zero/Zero W/Model A.
 - The 'Lite' version is stripped down to only run essential services at boot, and none of the Analysis services run by default.

!> Note: The Full version will NOT work properly on the single core boards - in particular OpenCV and any related software will not run at all.

| | Raspberry | Raspberry Lite |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Base Image | Rasbian Buster with desktop | Raspbian Buster Lite |
| OpenCV | Quad Core only | All CPUs, unoptimized |
| Tensorflow | Quad Core only | All CPUs, unoptimized |

- Write the image files to SD card (no need to uncompress if you use [Etcher](https://etcher.io/))
- (Optionally, if you don't have Ethernet networking available) [Add wifi configuration to SD card partition](/modules/network#raspberry-quick-start-wifi)
- Boot from the SD card (it should automatically expand the root partition/filesystem)
- (Optionally) [Run 'wifi-setup' to setup wireless networking](/modules/network#quick-start-wifi)
- [Get Started](#get-Started)

### Jetson Nano Instructions
The Jetson Nano platform is a 'first class' supported platform in Maverick - ie. we aim to provide an optimal experience on this platform.  Having said that, 
Jetson Nano support is in early stages so please reach out on gitter or github if you find problems or would like to suggest improvements.  The current image is based on Jetpack 4.4, and requires a 32Gb SD card.  To get started:
- Write the image files to SD card (no need to uncompress if you use [Etcher](https://etcher.io/))
- Boot from the SD card (it should automatically expand the root partition/filesystem)
- If the ethernet is plugged in, login over the network: `ssh mav@maverick-nano.local` (default password: *wingman*).  Otherwise attach a screen and keyboard.
- (Optionally) [Run 'wifi-setup' to setup wireless networking](/modules/network#quick-start-wifi)
- [Get Started](#get-Started)

### Desktop VM Instructions
The Desktop VM platform is a 'first class' supported platform in Maverick - ie. we aim to provide an optimal experience on this platform.  The Desktop VM download image is provided as a VirtualBox VM zip.  VirtualBox is a (mostly) free and opensource Virtual Machine software from Oracle (https://www.virtualbox.org/) which runs on most major platforms.  After installing VirtualBox, simply download the PC/Desktop VM image above, unzip and double click on the 'Maverick DesktopVM.vbox' file.  This should automatically create a new VM within your VirtualBox install.  You can then customize the VM settings, for example to add or remove virtual memory and CPUs, and then start the VM.  This VM image was created with VirtualBox 6.1.

### Aaeon Up Boards (Legacy version only)
Note: The Up boards are fantastic little computers and the Core and Core+ are ideally suited for UAVs - small and powerful.  Community builds are welcome.

A single image is provided for the Up board, Up^2 (Up Squared) and Up Core boards.  These boards run the OS from onboard eMMC, so the image is a 'flash' system - on boot it runs a utility (Clonezilla) that flashes the image to the boards eMMC storage.  The boards do not always boot from removeable storage by default, so it may be necessary to reconfigure the BIOS to boot from USB/SD card.

### Nvidia Tegra TX1/TX2 Instructions (Legacy version only)
Note: The TX2 was never tested, other than mixed results from the community.  Support for these should remain reasonably good as it is essentially the same JetPack platform that the Jetson Nano and Xavier NX use.  The Jetson Nano is a 'first class' supported platform in Maverick, as will be the Xavier NX.

Experimental images are provided for the Nvidia Tegra TX1 and TX2.  These images include everything needed to flash the TX1 or TX2 module from Ubuntu (14.04 or later), does not need any installed Jetpack or other Nvidia components, and does not need to match any existing installed Jetpack or L4T versions.  To install, unpack the image, put the module in recovery mode (either on the development board or on carrier board) and run the flasher:
 - Unpack image: 
   ```
   sudo tar xf maverick-1.1.5-tegratx1.tgz
   cd Maverick_for_Tegra
   ```
   
   !> Important: Ensure the maverick tar image is unpacked as root (through sudo or otherwise), otherwise permissions for the tegra root filesystem are not preserved and it will not work.
 - Put the module into recovery mode:
   - Unplug power.  Replug power.
   - Plug USB2 cable from Ubuntu host into carrier/development board.
   - Press power button.  Power lights should come on.
   - Press and hold recovery button, press and release reset button, wait 2 seconds and release recovery button.
   - `lsusb` should now show Nvidia device.
 - Flash Maverick image to module eMMC:
   ```
   sudo ./flash.sh -r jetson-tx1 mmcblk0p1
   ```

If you have a TX2, replace references in the above instructions from 'tx1' to 'tx2'.

## Get Started
If the installation and network setup was successful, you should now be able to connect over ssh (if you're using an OS that talks zeroconf like MacOS or Linux):  
Raspberry: `ssh maverick-raspberry.local`  
Raspberry Lite: `ssh maverick-raspberrylite.local`  
Jetson Nano: `ssh maverick-nano.locl`  
Desktop VM: `ssh maverick-desktopvm.local`  
Up: `ssh maverick-up.local`  
Tegra TX1/TX2: `ssh maverick-tegra.local`  

?> To get Zeroconf working in Windows, install Apple Bonjour: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999

You can also connect to the Web interface from any web browser:  
Raspberry: http://maverick-raspberry.local/  
Raspberry Lite: http://maverick-raspberrylite.local/  
Desktop VM: http://maverick-desktopvm.local/  
Jetson Nano: http://maverick-nano.local/  
etc..

?> **Note: The username is 'mav' and the default password is 'wingman' for both ssh and web access.**

After logging in, it's strongly recommended to firstly update and configure Maverick, this will bring it up to the latest codebase and in particular this will expand the root filesystem to fill the SD card you are using, if that has not already been done automatically:
```bash
maverick self-update
maverick configure
sudo reboot
```
When you reboot, it will resize the partitions and filesystems for you.

See what Maverick services are running:  
`maverick status`

The OS images are distributed with the 'Flight' environment active at boot.  This disables the dev services that should be turned in 'Dev' mode, or on faster computers that have the extra capacity.  To turn the dev services on, change to the dev environment:  
`maverick --env=dev configure`

To switch the environment back to 'Flight' mode:  
`maverick --env=flight configure`

See more things you can do with the `maverick` command:  
[Maverick Usage](#usage)

## Bootstrap Maverick
Maverick can be 'Bootstrapped' - that is installing, compiling and configuring the entire Maverick environment from scratch, on top of a base OS like Ubuntu or Debian.  If no ready-made image is available for your particular platform then this may be your only option.

!> Warning: This can take a LONG time depending on the hardware and speed of internet connection.  A full development install on a slow computer like a Raspberry Pi can take over 12 hours.  A full development install on a faster computer like a Desktop VM will typically take 1-2 hours depending on the amount of memory and CPU available.

- Maverick can be run from any new or existing supported OS installation.
- The provided OS images are simply a fresh vendor OS with Maverick bootstrapped using the available sample configs and are provided for convenience, as initial Maverick runs can take a long time due to compiling and installing lots of software.
- Once the initial Maverick run is complete, the system should be in exactly the same state as if installed from OS image.

First update the OS, download Maverick and do a bootstrap run and reboot:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
sudo apt-get install -y git && git clone https://github.com/goodrobots/maverick.git --depth 1
cd maverick && sudo ./bin/maverick --env=bootstrap configure
sudo reboot
```
Next, login as the 'mav' user (default password is 'wingman') and run Maverick with an end-state environment:  
For flight/production environment: `maverick --env=flight configure`  
Or for development environment: `maverick --env=dev configure`

Maverick will then calculate what needs to be done on the system and perform the changes, based on the configuration and underlying code.  This process can take a long time - between 1 and 24 hours depending on the speed of the hardware and network.  It provides output as it goes along but when doing large components (like compiling a large piece of software) it can appear to pause for a while.

## Usage
Maverick has a single main command: `maverick`.  It takes one mandatory argument which is a command.  If you run it without an argument, it will display a (hopefully) helpful usage screen.

### Self Update
self-update command updates Maverick itself.  If new features, bugfixes etc have been developed then this downloads the new code from github and self updates.  Note in order to take advantage of the new code, `maverick configure` must be run.  
`maverick self-update`

### Configure
The main action of maverick is to apply the combination of code and configuration to the system, mainly through the Configuration Management system (Puppet).  Initial runs can take hours to complete as it compiles code, applies configuration, sets up services etc.  Subsequent runs can take as little as a minute to complete if there are no or only very small updates to apply.  Even if there are no apparent updates, every time Maverick is run it scans the entire system to ensure it complies with the state described in the code and given configuration.  
`maverick configure`

There are three optional parameters for configure:
- --dryrun: this shows what changes would be applied to the system without actually applying them
- --env: this changes the system to a new environment.  Currently defined environments are _bootstrap_, _flight_ or _dev_.
- --module: this restricts the configure to a single module, any other changes will be ignored.  Modules are as named in ~/software/maverick/manifests/maverick-modules: *maverick_network*, *maverick_fc*, *maverick_vision* etc, eg.:  

`maverick configure --dryrun --env=dev --module=maverick_vision`

### Status/Info
Maverick gives some useful info/status:
- Status of all Maverick services:  
`maverick status`  
Status of a single Maverick service:  
`maverick status <service>`  
- System info:  
`maverick info`
- Network info:  
`maverick netinfo`

### Start/Stop/Restart
Maverick services (lefthand most column in `maverick status` output) can be easily started and stopped.  Note that Maverick services are implemented using systemd services with a 'maverick-' prefix, so the 'visiond' Maverick service is equivalent to 'maverick-visiond' systemd service (eg. `sudo systemctl status maverick-visiond`):
- Start service  
`maverick start <service>`
eg.
```bash
maverick status mavros@sitl
maverick start mavros@sitl
maverick status mavros@sitl
```
- Stop service  
`maverick stop <service>`
eg.
```bash
maverick status visiond
maverick start visiond
maverick status visiond
```
- Restart service is a convenience shortcut to stop and start a service:  
`maverick restart visiond`
- Stop all enabled services:  
`maverick stop all`  
- Start all enabled services:  
`maverick start all`  

### Log
While a lot of service output is logged to /srv/maverick/var/log, as the services are controlled through systemd some output is (only) available from the system journal.  Maverick provides a shortcut to view the latest live output for a service journal (equivalent to `sudo journalctl -u maverick-<service>`):  
`maverick log <service>`  
 eg.  
`maverick log mavproxy@fc`

### Enable/Disable
As well as starting and stopping services, Maverick can also set the services state at boot, which is called enabling and disabling as with systemd.  The difference between start and enable is that start starts the service immediately, whereas enable does not start the service immediately, but marks it to be started at boot time.  Most Maverick services are configured to start and enable, or stop and disable.  
`maverick enable visiond`  
 or
`maverick disable visiond`  

### Unshallow Git Repos
Most software components in Maverick that are installed directly from Git repos are installed as 'shallow' clone.  Shallow clones have a very limited history and a single specified branch, are much more efficient than full clones.  However, other branches cannot be changed to and any changes cannot be committed.  To allow full usage of a repo it must be un-shallowed.  Maverick provides a simple command to unshallow a clone:  
`maverick unshallow`  
This can only be run from the directory that will be un-shallowed.

## Layout and Config

### Layout
Maverick has a simple layout and is consistent across all platforms.  As part of the bootstrap, Maverick creates a 'mav' OS user which all services run under, and almost everything under Maverick control lives in the mav user home directory - /srv/maverick.  The exceptions to this are various config and manifests that need to live within OS system paths, for example /etc/systemd for service manifests and /etc/profile.d for various environment variables.  

Within /srv/maverick (the home directory for mav user), there are four main areas:
 - code : all coding, from ardupilot to dronecode to python to sample code
 - data : contains maverick and app config, app data, video output etc
 - software : all compiled and installed maverick software components, including maverick itself
 - var : all temporary or runtime files, logs, build areas

?> The '~' symbol in Linux means the current user home directory, so ~/ in the Maverick 'mav' user is /srv/maverick

These areas are designed so that the ~/code and ~/data directories will contain files that you will want to backup.  The ~/software directory and all the components within are installed as part of maverick install, do not need to be backed up and should not be altered.  The ~/var directory does not need to be backed up and contains temporary files created by various software components or running processes.

### Maverick Config
There are numerous methods of changing maverick config, and the config itself is extensive and complex.  The underlying mechanisms and various config options are explored further in [About](/about#about-maverick) and [Modules](/modules/intro).  However, to get started a single config file can be used: **~/config/maverick/localconf.json**.

#### localconf.json
This file can be used to set any parameter within the Maverick manifests.  It contains some basic sample config entries to get you started, but any class::parameter setting can be used here.  Like all files in ~/config it is specific and private to your computer and never committed back to Git, so is a good place to put settings like passwords and wifi access details.  A helper utility 'wifi-setup' will help you setup wifi settings within localconf.json more easily.  If any settings are changed, added or removed in localconf.json, `maverick configure` needs to be run to activate these changes.

#### Maverick code branch
The `maverick self-update` command updates the Maverick software itself from github, which is the primary mechanism for updating Maverick.  By default it updates from the 'stable' branch, which contains the latest code that has had at least some testing and review.  The config file *~/config/maverick/maverick-branch.conf* contains the github branch that Maverick will use to update.  Simply change this from 'stable' to 'master' and run `maverick self-update` to switch to the latest development code.  Unless you want to test changes to Maverick under development, it is strongly recommended to leave this as stable.

### App Config

#### Controlled config
'Controlled config' is where the config for an app or component is controlled by Maverick.  The config is controlled by changing/adding/deleting parameters in localconf.json and running `maverick configure`.  Maverick then calculates the influence of the parameters and generates the config.  It is important to note that in most cases if the generated config is changed manually it will be overwritten by Maverick the next time a configure run is performed.

Why have Controlled Config?  In some circumstances, the config for an app or component can be quite complex and difficult to setup, or once set is unlikely to be changed much.  Maverick tries to automate as much as possible for the end user and automating configuration is part of this process.  In addition, controlling config through localconf parameters allows the possibility of complete automation for building or cloning companion computers, all with consistent and repeatable settings.

#### Uncontrolled config
Uncontrolled config are traditional config files for apps or components that are not controlled by Maverick and can be altered by traditional editing.  In most cases default config files are provided by Maverick into ~/config, from which point on they are left for the end user to change as they wish.  This makes more sense where the user will want to quickly and easily alter settings, for example camera resolution.

All config settings are described in details in the [Modules](/modules/intro) documentation.

#### Changing control
Some parameters can be controlled or uncontrolled, by setting an associated localconf parameter.  For example, the mavlink configuration is normally controlled by Maverick.  The config file is dependent on the mavlink proxy in use so if mavlink-router is being using then the config file will be *~/config/mavlink/mavlink-router-[instance].conf* (Flight Controller config would therefore be *~/config/mavlink/mavlink-router-fc.conf*).  This file is normally controlled by Maverick so that port changes and configuration is kept consistent and updated automatically which can be a significant improvement to most systems.  However for advanced/expert usage you might want to manipulate this file directly.  In this case, you can set a localconf parameter:  
`"maverick_fc::mavlink_replaceconfig": false`  
Now you can directly alter the config file (*~/config/mavlink/mavlink-router-fc.conf*) and Maverick will not overwrite it the next time `maverick configure` is run.  
A similar parameter exists for the dev environment:  
`"maverick_dev::apsitl::mavlink_replaceconfig": false`  
More parameters will be added in the future.

### Module config
The *~/config* (/srv/maverick/config) directory is laid out by module, so if you are looking for a configuration for a particular [module](/modules), look in *~/config/*[module] (eg *~/config/vision*).  The config in these module directories will be generated from manifests in *~/software/maverick/manifests/maverick-modules/maverick_*[module] (eg. *~/software/maverick/manifests/maverick-modules/maverick_vision*).
